## Notes

#### Window functions

- rectangular window

- Hamming window

- Hanning window

- Bartlett window

- Blackman window

- Kaiser window

#### FIR filter design

- window method

- steps:

  - choosing filter (lowpass、highpass、bandpass、bandstop)
  
  - defining filter spec. (cutoff frequency)
  
  - choosing sampling frequency
  
  - choosing window function and number of taps
  
  - calculating FIR filter coefficients
  
  - checking frequency response

#### IIR filter design

- categories: 

  - Butterworth Filters

  - Chebyshev type 1 filter

  - Chebyshev type 2 filter

  - elliptic filter
  
- steps: 

  - choosing filter (lowpass、highpass、bandpass、bandstop)
  
  - defining filter spec. (cutoff frequency)
  
  - choosing sampling frequency
  
  - calculating order and -3dB cutoff frequency
  
  - calculating IIR filter coefficients
  
  - checking frequency response
