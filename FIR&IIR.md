## Notes

#### Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter

- Linear time-invariant & causal system

- In z-plane, FIR has only zeros and no poles. (steady system)

- Applications:

  - moving average filter
  
  - Nulling filter (Notch filter)
  
    - It can cancel jamming signals.
    
    - Comparing to original signal, the output signal of nulling filter has the time-delay phenomena.
    
#### Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter

- Linear time-invariant & causal system

- Feedback system and Recursive filter

- Impulse responses:

  - unit response
  
  - step response
  
- Applications:

  - echo system
